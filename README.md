# PSReadScript
PSReadscript is a module which contains two Functions Read-PSFile and Read-PSScript. Development of this module started by getting
motivated from PSReadline script even though the functionality varies a lot.

## Read-PSScript
This Function can be used to read a PowerShell script in console with Line numbers. This could be handy incase of a remote PSSession to a Nano server. This Function is having the abaility to run the script provided and show the error occurring line by highlighting the line.
This can be used for getting consolidated error details after executing the entire script.

## Read-PSFile
This script can be compared to the Find option in Notepad++, where we can search for a string in multiple files.But here it completely from console and is very usefull if we are in a Nano server. This wil show us the string occuring line with line number and file name.
